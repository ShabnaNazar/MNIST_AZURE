# MNIST_AZURE

#### Use case: Train and deploy an image classification model in Azure Machine Learning using MNIST dataset

As part of the assignemnt, i have tried to implment the code using Azure ML. During the experimentation or poc phase I have done the below steps deploy the model as a real time endpoint. 


##### Download a dataset and look at the data
##### Train an image classification model and log metrics using MLflow
##### Check the Model performance matrix
##### Deploy the model to a real time endpoint
##### Test the model using a web request
