# MNIST_AZURE

#### Use case: Train and deploy an image classification model in Azure Machine Learning using MNIST dataset

As part of the assignemnt, i have tried to implment the code using Azure ML. During the experimentation or poc phase I have done the below steps deploy the model as a real time endpoint. 


##### * Download a dataset and look at the data
##### * Train an image classification model and log metrics using MLflow
##### * Check the Model performance matrix
##### * Deploy the model to a real time endpoint
##### * Test the model using a web request
